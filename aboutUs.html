                Poverty has long been an endemic problem in developing countries. The role of corporate organizations in fostering or undermining development within poor local communities in developing countries has been a subject of intensive debate within academic and practitioners’ circle. Through the Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), we have demonstrated commitments to the reduction of poverty in the country by following socially responsible practices thereby making the growth generated by the private sector more inclusive, equitable and poverty reducing.
                <br> <br>
                We see investments in our society as that avenue given to us as a team to collectively reach out to others and fulfil our innate desire to make a difference. We consider this the only way we can build a sustainable business.

                Poverty has long been an endemic problem in developing countries. The role of corporate organizations in fostering or undermining development within poor local communities in developing countries has been a subject of intensive debate within academic and practitioners’ circle. Through the Bank’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), we have demonstrated commitments to the reduction of poverty in the country by following socially responsible practices thereby making the growth generated by the private sector more inclusive, equitable and poverty reducing.
                <br> <br>
                We see investments in our society as that avenue given to us as a team to collectively reach out to others and fulfil our innate desire to make a difference. We consider this the only way we can build a sustainable business.
                <br> <br>
